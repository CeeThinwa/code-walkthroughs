any interactions I have with my fans and lovers
of my content. As creators, we always dream of
having our art reach and impact as many people
as possible. So, to have fans show appreciation for
my work, and even detail out what it means to
them, is something I truly treasure.
I view my relationship with fans as a symbiotic
one rather than a predatory one, where both
parties are continuously gaining from each
other. Fans relish in the quality of content while
the celebrity basks in the attention (likes, views,
comments, shares) that comes with it.
Did you ever see yourself on this career
5
path when you were younger? What would
you say to your younger self?
Absolutely not! I mean, I always hoped that
I'd end up in the creative industry but as a
comedian? Haha. That never crossed my mind.
But, I am extremely glad and grateful that I
ended up here and that I get to make thousands
of people laugh. I would tell my younger self to
start. Just start. You don't need to wait till you
have an expensive camera, phone or lights. The
resources you have, however little, are enough.
