## Vision

To make news articles searchable and shine the spotlight on more human interest stories from interesting Kenyans from all walks of life.

## Problem

Diverse portraits of everyday Kenyans tend to be buried under the celebrity and influencer culture dominating Kenyan online blogs and Kenyan YouTube channels. However, print media in Kenya still has a good amount of human interest stories. However, these stories are shown as scanned flipbooks, which can be hard to search through. Having them in this format also means that you canâ€™t cluster different articles around human interest topics like entrepreneurship, cuisine, family etc.

## Mission

Provide a solution from scanned newspaper articles that allows the most relevant human interest stories to be categorized by authors and human interest topics.

## Potential Audience

* Writers working for Kenyan media houses.
* Curious Kenyans seeking to learn about other Kenyans. 

## Project Sections

1. **Image Annotation**<br>
This project began with looking at the scanned images (which passed through a max A3 printer).
Image segmentation was tackled in 2 parts:<br>
   i. &nbsp;&nbsp; [Image Annotation I](./kip-pg1.ipynb)<br>
   ii. &nbsp; [Image Annotation II](./kip-pg2.ipynb)
2. **Text Recognition**<br>
Based on the research done on programmatic image segmentation, the end decision was to segment the articles manually.<br>
This was tackled here: [Text Recognition](./kip-pg3.ipynb)
3. **Article Searchability**
4. **Front-end Development**
